## Personal Goal

My personal goal of this project was to reinforce the basic concepts of React + TypeScript.
Coding this app made me feel more and more confortable and familiar with TypeScript and it's integration with React, which I found very convenient and powerful.

The project idea comes from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application).

### About the project

The first build of the app is basic and straightforward yet it is capable of supporting new implementations and features in the future.

### Tools:

- CRA + TypeScript template (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)
- Styled Components (https://styled-components.com/)
- html-to-image (https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image)
- downloadjs (https://www.npmjs.com/package/downloadjs)
